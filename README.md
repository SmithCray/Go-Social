# Go-Social

#

[Go-Social](https://github.com/SmithCray/Go-Social) is an example of a API used for a Social Network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend a ist. We will be focusing on the back-end portion using [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to test our routes and [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) to build our database.
